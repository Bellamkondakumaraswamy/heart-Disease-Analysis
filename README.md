# ❤️ Heart Disease Analysis using Tableau

An interactive **data visualization and analytics project** focused on understanding key **heart disease risk factors** through **Tableau dashboards, stories, and a live web application**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Heart Disease Analysis** project aims to explore and understand key factors influencing heart disease using interactive visual analytics. By leveraging **Tableau**, this project brings together multiple dimensions of health-related data such as **age, gender, lifestyle habits, clinical indicators, and comorbid conditions like diabetes and stroke**.

The project transforms complex healthcare datasets into **intuitive dashboards and story-based visualizations**, enabling users to identify patterns, assess risk factors, and derive insights efficiently. This data-driven approach supports **informed decision-making, early detection, and increased awareness** of heart disease.
